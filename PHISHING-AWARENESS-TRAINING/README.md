## 🚨 What is Phishing?

Phishing is a **cyber deception technique** where criminals impersonate trusted entities—such as banks, retailers, or social media platforms—to steal sensitive information. These scams are often carried out through **emails, fake websites, or fraudulent messages.**

- 🔹 Example: You may receive an email appearing to be from your bank, requesting you to update your details. However, the link directs you to a **fake website** that collects your data.

## ⚠️ Why is Phishing Dangerous?

- 🔹 **Identity Theft:** Stolen personal details can be used to create fraudulent accounts.
- 🔹 **Financial Loss:** Attackers may gain access to **bank accounts and credit card details**.
- 🔹 **Malware Installation:** Phishing emails often contain links or attachments that install malware, ransomware, or spyware on your device.

## 🎭 Common Types of Phishing
